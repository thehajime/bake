Bake, a software construction tool
==================================

Bake is not a make, autoconf, or automake replacement. 
Bake is not a replacement for the package management
tool that can be found on your how system. In short, Bake
is not quite like what you are used to see around. Instead,
Bake is an integration tool which is used by software 
developers to automate the reproducible build of a number 
of projects which depend on each other and which might be 
developed, and hosted by unrelated parties.
